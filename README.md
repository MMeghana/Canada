# Canada

It is a number where the sum of squares of the digits of n is equal to the sum of non-trival divisors of n.

Input: n= 125

Explanation:
sum of sq of digits of 125 : 1^2 + 2^2 + 5^2 = 1+4+25 = 30
125 factors are : 1 , 5 , 25 , 125 = 5+25 = 30

non-trival divisors of n:
(sum of divisors of n) - 1- n

Output: Canada number
